# Redhopper plugin

Kanban boards for Redmine, inspired by *Jira Agile* (formerly known as *Greenhopper*), but following its own path.

## Wait. But why?

Yep, we are building yet another Kanban plugin for Redmine. The difference this time is the **extensive use of Redmine core concepts** (issues, trackers, workflow, etc.) instead of building everything from scratch.

No need to define columns, your issue statuses are good enough. No need to define allowed transitions, your workflow already does it. Get a useful board in seconds. We believe this is the only way to **achieve fast adoption** for teams already using Redmine like us.
